# 🌿 Baunilha dos Açores — Vanilla Research in the Azores

Welcome to **Baunilha dos Açores** (Vanilla of the Azores), a unique research and agrotourism project on São Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal.

## About Us

We're experimenting with something unusual: cultivating vanilla—a tropical orchid—in greenhouse conditions on a Portuguese island. Why vanilla? Why the Azores? And how does it work?
