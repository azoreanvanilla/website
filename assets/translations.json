Years ago, I had a vague dream about growing cocoa, but it was never a serious plan. Life took different turns. Then we moved to the Azores with our family, and something shifted. I found myself remembering that old idea, but this time I wanted to understand what was actually possible here.",
    "about_vanilla_core": "After researching what would work here, I looked for something tropical, rare, edible, compact, high-demand. Vanilla emerged as the answer—a totally uncommon plant for the Azores, yet perfectly suited to controlled greenhouse conditions. While the island's winter nights drop to 10°C—too cold for outdoor tropical cultivation—that's only part of the story. September through April brings persistent strong winds and salty air that vanilla orchids find hostile. Between the cold and the coastal environment, outdoor cultivation is simply impossible. That's precisely why greenhouses make sense. We control the environment. Temperature, humidity, light, air quality—these become variables we can manage and optimize. What started as a hobby experiment has become something real. Today, we're growing over 200 meters of vanilla vines. It's taught me that agriculture, like cybersecurity, demands precision—in temperature, humidity, light, pollination timing. The same mindset applies: observe carefully, measure everything, iterate based on what you learn. We're not trying to be experts in everything. We're just being rigorous about what we do.",

Anos atrás, tive um vago sonho sobre cultivar cacau, mas nunca foi um plano sério. A vida tomou outros caminhos. Depois mudámo-nos para os Açores com a família, e algo mudou. Encontrei-me a lembrar dessa antiga ideia, mas desta vez queria compreender o que era realmente possível aqui.",
    "about_vanilla_core": "Depois de pesquisar o que funcionaria aqui, procurei algo tropical, raro, comestível, compacto, com elevada procura. A baunilha emergiu como a resposta—uma planta totalmente invulgar para os Açores, mas perfeitamente adequada a condições de estufa controladas. Enquanto as noites de inverno da ilha caem para 10°C—demasiado frio para o cultivo tropical ao ar livre—isso é apenas parte da história. De setembro a abril, ventos fortes persistentes e ar salgado tornam o cultivo exterior hostil para as orquídeas de baunilha. Entre o frio e o ambiente costeiro, o cultivo ao ar livre é simplesmente impossível. É exatamente por isso que as estufas fazem sentido. Controlamos o ambiente. Temperatura, humidade, luz, qualidade do ar—estas tornam-se variáveis que podemos gerir e otimizar. O que começou como uma experiência de hobby tornou-se algo real. Hoje, estamos a cultivar mais de 200 metros de videiras de baunilha. Ensinou-me que a agricultura, como a cibersegurança, exige precisão—em temperatura, humidade, luz, timing da polinização. O mesmo mindset aplica-se: observar cuidadosamente, medir tudo, iterar com base no que aprendes. Não estamos a tentar ser peritos em tudo. Simplesmente estamos a ser rigorosos no que fazemos.",
